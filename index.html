    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p>
        Dhikr 24/7 does not require user registration or login.
        We do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information such as name, email address, phone
        number, or precise location.
    </p>

    <h2>Automatically Collected Information</h2>
    <p>
        The app does not intentionally collect personal data.
        Basic non-personal information may be collected automatically by the Android platform or Google Play Services,
        including device type, operating system version, and crash reports, solely to improve app performance and
        stability.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        The app may use standard Google services such as Google Play Services.
        These services may collect limited non-personal data as governed by their respective privacy policies.
        Dhikr 24/7 does not control or store this data.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
        Since Dhikr 24/7 does not collect personal data, there is minimal risk of data misuse.
        We take reasonable steps to ensure the app remains secure and reliable.
